# Calculator Project

A simple web-based calculator built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## About

My first standalone JavaScript project outside the curriculum. It helped me explore DOM manipulation, event handling, and arithmetic evaluation.

**Key implementation details:**
- Event listeners instead of `onclick` attributes
- Custom state flags (`justEvaluated`, `opClicked`) to manage input flow
- Uses `eval()` for expression evaluation (planned for refactoring)

## Features

- Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Error handling for invalid operations (displays `ERROR`)
- Proper chaining of operators after evaluation
- Clear button (`C`) and equals button (`=`)

## Future Improvements

- Remove `eval()` and implement manual parsing (I already tried it in script.js file )
- Add advanced operations (parentheses, percentages)
- Enhance mobile responsiveness

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Click buttons to input numbers and operators
3. Press `=` to evaluate, `C` to clear
